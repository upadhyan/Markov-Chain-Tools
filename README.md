# Markov-Chain-Tools
This is a small project I started independently to better understand markov chains. This is still a work in progress and not formalized. 

The end goals of this project is that users can input a transition matrix representing a markov process and use this toolbox to determine

* Qualities about the chain (ex. whether or not the process is regular, ergodic, disconnected, etc.)
* Various metrics surrounding the chain(ex. Mean Soujourn Times, Steady State Probabilities, Mean First Passage Time, etc.)

The code can be found in [the attached notebook](https://github.com/upadhyan/Markov-Chain-Tools/blob/main/Markov_Chain_Functions.ipynb)
